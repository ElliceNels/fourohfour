# Penetration Testing Report

## Executive Summary
This report details the security assessment conducted on our file sharing application, covering both client and server-side components. The testing was performed with the assumption that neither client nor server can be fully trusted, implementing a zero-trust security model.

## Scope
- Server-side API endpoints
- Client-side web application
- Authentication mechanisms
- File handling and permissions
- Database interactions
- Cryptographic implementations

## Methodology
1. Automated vulnerability scanning
2. Manual penetration testing
3. Code review
4. Security configuration audit
5. Authentication testing
6. Access control verification

## Findings and Remediation

### 1. Improper Input Validation

#### Test Case: Buffer Overflow in File Upload
**Description**: Attempted to upload files with excessive sizes and malformed headers to test buffer handling.

**Findings**: 
- No direct buffer overflow vulnerabilities found
- Application uses Python's built-in memory management
- Flask's request size limits are properly configured

**Protection Mechanisms**:
- Input validation in file upload routes
- Size limits enforced at both client and server
- Proper error handling and logging implemented

#### Test Case: Integer Overflow in Permission Management
**Description**: Tested permission creation with extreme values and invalid IDs.

**Findings**:
- SQLAlchemy's type system prevents integer overflow
- Proper validation of user and file IDs
- Error handling for invalid numeric inputs

**Protection Mechanisms**:
- Type checking in database models
- Input validation in permission routes
- Proper error responses for invalid inputs

### 2. Broken Authentication

#### Test Case: JWT Token Security
**Description**: Analyzed JWT implementation and token handling.

**Findings**:
- JWT tokens properly implemented with expiration
- Secure token storage in client
- Proper refresh token rotation

**Protection Mechanisms**:
- JWT_SECRET_KEY properly configured
- Token expiration and refresh mechanisms
- Secure cookie handling

### 3. Broken Access Control

#### Test Case: File Permission Bypass
**Description**: Attempted to access files without proper permissions.

**Findings**:
- Proper permission checks implemented
- Owner verification in place
- No IDOR vulnerabilities found

**Protection Mechanisms**:
- Permission verification in file access routes
- Owner validation in permission management
- Proper error handling for unauthorized access

### 4. Cryptographic Issues

#### Test Case: File Encryption Implementation
**Description**: Analyzed file encryption and key management.

**Findings**:
- Proper implementation of asymmetric encryption
- Secure key storage and transmission
- No hardcoded keys found

**Protection Mechanisms**:
- Public/private key pair generation
- Secure key exchange mechanism
- Proper encryption key management

### 5. Injection

#### Test Case: SQL Injection in File Queries
**Description**: Attempted SQL injection through file operations.

**Findings**:
- No SQL injection vulnerabilities found
- Proper use of parameterized queries
- Input sanitization in place

**Protection Mechanisms**:
- SQLAlchemy ORM usage
- Parameterized queries
- Input validation

### 6. Security Misconfiguration

#### Test Case: Server Configuration
**Description**: Analyzed server and application configuration.

**Findings**:
- Proper CORS configuration
- Secure headers implemented
- Debug mode disabled in production

**Protection Mechanisms**:
- Environment-based configuration
- Secure default settings
- Proper error handling

### 7. Sensitive Data Exposure

#### Test Case: File Content Protection
**Description**: Analyzed file content handling and storage.

**Findings**:
- Proper file encryption
- Secure storage implementation
- No sensitive data exposure

**Protection Mechanisms**:
- File content encryption
- Secure storage mechanisms
- Proper access controls

### 8. Vulnerable Components

#### Test Case: Dependency Analysis
**Description**: Analyzed application dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

**Findings**:
- All dependencies up to date
- No known vulnerabilities in used packages
- Proper version pinning

**Protection Mechanisms**:
- Regular dependency updates
- Version pinning in requirements
- Security scanning of dependencies

## Recommendations
1. Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
2. Add additional logging for security events
3. Regular security audits of dependencies
4. Implement automated security testing in CI/CD

## Conclusion
The application demonstrates strong security measures across all tested areas. No critical vulnerabilities were found, and existing protections effectively mitigate common attack vectors. Regular security testing and updates are recommended to maintain security posture.
